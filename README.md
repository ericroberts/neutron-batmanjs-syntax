# Neutron BatmanJS Syntax Theme for Atom

Complementing syntax theme for the [Neutron UI](http://atom.io/packages/neutron-ui) package. Inspired by the immense work of [@brentd](https://atom.io/users/brentd) on Neutron UI and the Neutron Syntax theme. This theme is based on Shopifyâ€™s [BatmanJS](http://batmanjs.org) branding and color scheme.

**Note:** this theme changes line-height, and there is currently a bug which incorrectly calculates line-height until you switch tabs. If your cursor is out of whack, just switch tabs.
