# Neutron UI BatmanJS Syntax Theme

![Neutron BatmanJS Syntax](http://f.cl.ly/items/3t1f0X390v0k2p3j1n3V/Image%202014-04-16%20at%204.32.19%20PM.png)

Complementing syntax theme for the [Neutron UI](http://atom.io/packages/neutron-ui) package. Inspired by the immense work of [@brentd](https://atom.io/users/brentd) on Neutron UI and the Neutron Syntax theme. This theme is based on Shopifyâ€™s [BatmanJS](http://batmanjs.org) branding and color scheme.

**Note:** this theme changes line-height, and there is currently a bug which incorrectly calculates line-height until you switch tabs. If your cursor is out of whack, just switch tabs.
